# Dynamic Analysis of the non-motorized mechanisms for human lower limb rehabilitation applying the Finite Elements Method

The main reference of this work is described [here](https://repositorio.ufu.br/handle/123456789/18982) in portuguese (english version coming soon).

This work is a complementary file for the mathematical model of non-motorized mechanisms developed to perform rehabilitation exercises for the human lower limb. There are three designs, one for each joint of the lower limb (hip, knee and ankle). The mechanisms are based on the crank-rocker fourbar linkage, with geometrics designed to match the flexion-extension angular amplitude of each joint on the follower bar. In this notebook, we implement a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to identificate the Frequency Response Function (FRF) of the mechanisms on each position.  This analysis will be performed for each mechanism separately.
